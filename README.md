# admin-dashboard
<h2>Project Goals:</h2>
<p>Create an admin dashboard based off of the provided mockup (found inside the resources folder). The goal is to use mainly CSS grid and HTML to create this project.   </p>
<h2>Skills Used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS Grid</li>
  <li>CSS Flexbox</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reflection:</h2>
<p>This projectâ€™s goal was to demonstrate everything we learn in the grid section of The Odin Project.</p> 

<p>I made it a goal to also implement some of the other features that at the time I was not as familiar with, such as using the em unit for sizing certain things, and trying to utilize different CSS selectors and combiners for CSS parent, children and siblings. While the goals were to use mainly CSS Grid to complete this project, I also was able to combine some FlexBox into the cards for added responsiveness.</p> 

<p>As you can see in my code, I also used different manners of laying out the grids (template areas vs column & rows) in order to help solidify my knowledge in how to best use the grid. </p>

<p><em>A future goal for this project is to return to it at a later date and add complete responsiveness to the dash board, allowing it to be mobile, tablet and desktop friendly.</em></p>

<p><strong>My Process:</strong></p> 
<p>I had to adjust my process a few different times in order to complete this project. Overall what I found worked best for me was starting it out by hand drawing the grid and each of the sub sections so that I could break it down piece by piece, from there, I recreated the main container of the grid using different background colors and border colors to layout the project digitally. I repeated that process for each of the subsections. Once I had the overall layout of the main container and the subsections complete. I was able to go back and fine tune each subsection so that it matched the original design file.</p>
